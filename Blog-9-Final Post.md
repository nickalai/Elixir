# Blog 9: That's all folks!

## A brief recap, analysis and reflection of the project.

Learning about Elixir was both an amazing experience and probably the most confusing experience of our semester. Considering none of us had ever used an immutable language before, the concept of not being able to use while loops was baffling yet enlightening. Our final project was quite a stretch in what we felt like we could accomplish, and while we did not exactly get to what we had hoped for, I feel as though we got quite close ([See Blog-8](Blog-8.md) and our [Source Code](Source%20Code/Messages) for this portion of the project)


Nick:

Although we do have a script that allows for messaging between different "users" aka processes (#PIDs), I was never able to test it on multiple computers as I did not finish it until towards the project's due date. I did, however, make sure it worked on at least a single system, and got it to declare multiple difference processes in the same terminal. Before, I was fumbling around with the IO of Elixir, but it just did not feel very...correct for what I was trying to accomplish. And after further research, I found out that it really wasn't correct. IO made me struggle because it would always store with a newline at the end of anything you input, and I had no idea how to get rid of it. This made it so that you couldn't do math at all like how you would with Java or C++ for example. No blog post was written on IO because I felt as though nothing was particulary accomplished, but IO.gets() would be similar to cin in C++, which receives command line input whereas IO.puts is the same as a cout in C++ where it prints to the console.
