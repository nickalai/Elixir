# Concept Doc
For our class project, we decided to create a simple yet protected direct messaging system. Be it in game design or app development, direct messages are vital for communication between others. In addition, protection over private messages is vital in any form of messaging service, as the messages sent were only intended to be read by those who received them.

We are all interested in game and app development, so everything we develop during this time can be used in the future in any social related app we create. Although our scope may seem too large, we simply plan on being able to send private messages on a local network between multiple computers without allowing another computer on the network to interfere.

We will be creating this system by using the programming language, Elixir (which is built off of Erlang). Doing so will allow us to expand our knowledge on programming languages as a whole and give us the opportunity to study a more obscure/unpopular language.
