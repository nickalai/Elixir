# Setting up Elixir

1. First, install Elixir using the instructions found on the [Elixir website](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html). You can confirm you have elixir installed if you run the command 'elixir --version'. If this command outputs an error stating erl not found, it means erlang is not installed. If you don't have erlang installed, install that now.


2. One you have Elixir installed, run the command 'iex'. This stands for "Interactive Elixir" and here you will be able to test Elixir expressions. Test this out by typing "IO.puts "Hello world". You should see iex output "Hello world"  followed by an OK.

3. To test if you are able to run scripts, create a file called "helloworld.exs" with contents "IO.puts "Hello world". You should then be able to run the script by calling "elixir helloworld.exs". If the output is "Hello world", you have successfully installed Elixir.
