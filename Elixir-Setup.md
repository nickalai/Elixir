1. First, install Elixir using the instructions found on the [Elixir website](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html). You can confirm you have elixir installed if you run the command 'elixir --version'

2. One you have Elixir installed, run the command 'iex'. This stands for "Interactive Elixir" and here you will be able to test Elixir expressions. Test this out by typing "IO.puts "Hello world". You should see iex output "Hello world"  followed by an OK.
