# Elixir
Welcome to our Elixir blog. Here we (Nick Lai, Charlie Liu, and Cole Gotelli) will be exploring some of the features that Elixir offers and how they relate to our Programming Languages course. We plan to create a messaging application because Elixir is a very powerful tool for efficently connecting many devices. We aim to both, gain a better understanding of how programming languages work in general, as well as have a specific example to which we can apply this knowledge.
